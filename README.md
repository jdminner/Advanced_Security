# Advanced_Security
I describe CASP+ as advanced management concepts, including all the technical concepts required in the previous courses, but through enterprise application, rather than just small network/company application.  This means security architecture and senior security engineering in traditional, cloud, and hybrid environments, governance, risk, and compliance; assessing an enterpriseâ€™s cybersecurity readiness, and leading technical teams to implement enterprise-wide cybersecurity solutions.
